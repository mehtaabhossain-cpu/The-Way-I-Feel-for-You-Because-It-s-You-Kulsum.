        <h2>From My Heart 💌</h2>
        <p>
          Kulsum,<br><br>
          You didn’t just enter my life — you changed the way my heart beats.<br><br>
          Every scroll you take here… is a step deeper into what I truly feel for you ❤️. Kulsum, sometimes I wonder how one person can carry so much magic within her ✨, and then I remember—it’s you 🌹. You walk into my life without noise, without trying, and still you manage to touch places in my heart I didn’t even know existed 💖. Every time I think of you, something inside me becomes soft, peaceful, and unbelievably happy 🫶, like my soul finally found a home 🏡💗. You have no idea how special you are to me… how your name alone feels like a prayer on my lips 🌙, how your smile feels like the safest place in the world 🤍😊. I don’t know how destiny works, but if destiny ever wrote something beautiful for me, it’s your presence in my life ✍️💞. When I talk to you, everything else becomes small; when I look at you, even silence feels full of meaning 🌌. I don’t need a thousand reasons to love you—your existence itself is enough ❤️‍🔥. You’re the kind of girl who doesn’t just enter someone’s heart… you become a part of its rhythm 💓. And trust me, Kulsum, if you could see yourself through my eyes, even for a second, you would understand why my heart melts for you every single day 🫶

        <h2>What I Feel But Never Say 🌙</h2>
        <p>
          I don’t always express everything perfectly,<br>
          but every moment with you makes me feel safe, calm, and understood.<br><br>
         Sometimes silence speaks the loudest — and in that silence, I always choose you ❤️.
Kulsum, there is so much inside me that my words fail to express 🥺✨, so much I carry in my heart quietly… and all of it is you 💖. I act normal, I smile casually 🙂, but deep down every moment with you feels like something precious, something I don’t ever want to lose 💞.

What I never say is how my world softens when I hear your name 🌙, how my heart reacts before my mind even understands 💓. I don’t say how your presence makes me feel complete in a way nothing else ever did 🌼, or how your smile has become the little light I look for even on the darkest days 🌟.

I don’t say how deeply I cherish the simplest conversations with you 🫶, how they stay with me long after they end 💭💗.
But if I could open my heart for a second, you would see how every beat, every hope, every silent wish is connected to you ❤️‍🔥.

Kulsum, what I feel but never say is that you are the most beautiful part of my life 🌹… and loving you, even silently, feels like the truest thing my heart has ever known 🤍.

I am mad for you madammmmmm 😭❤️.
You think that I will leave you later… but I love you more than you think 🥺🫶.
It’s all about priority and seriousness for you 💗. I hope you understand… Mere liye Kulsum hi sahi 😘💞.

Maybe you will be the best person in my life ahead 🌷… but I will always pray to God for you 🤲❤️.
I know you rejected me, but still I pray that whoever you marry in the future, he should be kind, loving, and gentle with your heart 💐… because you are sensitive, pure, and you get hurt easily 💕.
And that’s my love for you — I always want you to be happy and smiling 😊💖.

Allah knows how much I have loved you and who you are in my heart 🕊️💗… and that’s you, madam Kulsum 🌹.
May Allah always bless you 🤲✨.

I’m sorry to say this today… but I LOVE YOU A LOT ❤️🔥.
I had a bad past too, just like you… so please don’t underestimate me or misunderstand me 😔💔.

These are all my feelings for you 🫶💞… I hope you understand.
I won’t even tell you why I told you all this… because deep down, you already know the reason ❤️✨.
These are all my efforts…

        <h2>If You Ever Doubt My Love… 💖</h2>
        <p>
          Remember this: you are the person I think of when the world gets heavy,<br>
          the name my heart whispers on quiet nights.<br><br>
          My love doesn’t shout — it stays. It holds. It chooses you. Kulsum, if you ever doubt my love, I want you to pause for a moment and feel how deeply your name lives inside my heart. My love for you isn’t loud or showy—it’s steady, constant, and woven into everything I do. If one day the world feels heavy and you wonder if someone truly cares, I want you to remember that I am here, loving you in ways I don’t always say but always feel. My love is in the way I think of you before I sleep and again the moment I wake up. It’s in the way your happiness matters to me more than my own. It’s in the silent prayers I make just for you, without you even knowing. Kulsum, if you ever doubt for even a second whether you mean something to me, know this—my love for you is not a moment, not a phase, not a feeling that fades. It is something written into me, something that grows deeper every time I see your smile or hear your voice. And no matter what happens, my heart will always find its way back to you, again and again. Because loving you, Kulsum ❤️ is not something I learned… it’s something my heart simply knew 💗. Even in the moments when we’re silent 🤫, when we’re far 🌙, or when life pulls us into different directions, a part of me is always reaching for you 🤍, always thinking of you 💭, always holding onto the warmth you bring ✨. You might not see it, but I carry you with me in everything—your laughter in my happiest thoughts 😊, your comfort in my quiet moments 🤍, your softness in the way I speak 💞, your presence in the way I breathe 🌹. You have become a part of my life so naturally, so beautifully, that sometimes I forget there was ever a time without you 💫.

And if you ever feel insecure, unsure, or scared about us 🥺, I want you to remember this truth: I chose you with my whole heart ❤️, and I will choose you every time, without hesitation 💍. I will choose you on your good days 🌼 and on your difficult days 🌧️. I will choose you when you’re smiling 😊 and when you’re hiding your tears 😢. I will choose you when you feel confident ✨ and even more when you feel fragile 💗. Because my love for you isn’t based on perfection—it’s based on connection, on the way your soul speaks to mine in a language only we understand 💞🌙.

Kulsum, if you ever doubt my love, just place your hand over your heart 💓 and feel its rhythm… because somewhere inside that rhythm, my heart beats with yours ❤️‍🔥. I don’t care how many years pass or what changes in this world 🌍—my feelings for you will never be something temporary. You are someone I’m grateful for every day 🙏, someone I pray for quietly 🤲, someone whose happiness I want to protect with everything in me 🫶.

So, if a single moment comes where your mind questions your worth, your beauty, or my love 💕, remember this: you are my peace 🕊️, my softness 🌸, my favourite kind of miracle ✨💗. And I will keep loving you—slowly, deeply, endlessly ♾️❤️—not because I have to, but because my heart doesn’t know any other way. 💖🌹
